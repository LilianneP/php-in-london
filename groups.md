# Groups & Projects

List of **non-commercial** groups and projects with the goal to talk PHP or write PHP (open-source projects, start-up ideas, hackatons). When adding a group, sort them by name and use this format:

``` markdown

Some Markdown formatting for naming links is fine.

A collection of companies organized alphabetically. Names that begin with a number e.g. 99 Designs, should be organized under **Numbers**.
