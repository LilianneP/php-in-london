# Open-Source Projects

List of **open-source** projects with authors or major contributors living in close proximity to London. Participating in open-source project is great opportunity to learn and to help community. Seek out author/contributor at the next PHP London event for a chat:

``` markdown
### Project Name

```

Some Markdown formatting for naming links is fine.

A collection of projects are  organized alphabetically. Names that begin with a number e.g. 99 Designs, should be organized under **Numbers**.
